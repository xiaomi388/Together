# Together
Together is a peer-to-peer chat room based on WebRTC with features below:

1. supports video chat and text input.
2. **supports watching videos together**. With together, you can watch videos from local files or on YouTube. Currently we use the video player plugin [react-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player), so we support videos from websites which react-player supports.

## TODO

1. Implement file transfer.
2. Beautify the UI.
