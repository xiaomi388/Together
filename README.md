# Together
Together is a peer-to-peer chat room based on WebRTC with features below:

1. Supports video chat and text input.
2. **Supports watching videos together**. With Together, you could watch videos from local files or online videos with your close friend synchronously, which means you could both be in the exactly same moment of a video. When one stops/plays/seeks the video, the video player of the other person will do the exactly same action. Currently we use the video player plugin [react-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player), so we support videos from websites which react-player supports.
